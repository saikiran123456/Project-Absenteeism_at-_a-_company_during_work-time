# Project-Absenteeism_at_a_company_during_work-time
The purpose of the business exercise will be to explore whether a person presenting certain characteristics is expected to be away from work at some point in time or not.

**The Main AIM of this Project is that to show how i can integrate different Softwares through API Integrations**

- Integrating: Python + MySQL + Tableau  to solve the Business problem

‚úÖ To solve any Business Problems - I like to Connect Python with various Sources like Databases and Visualization software like Tableau and PowerBI.
In short, I like the entire pipeline which solves business problems using Software API Integrations.

‚óè Business Problem:
üòé Developing a Machine Learning Model to predict 'Absenteeism at a company during work time' with good accuracy!!

‚óè Final outcome:
To develop a model that will predict the probability of an individual being excessively absent from work with visualizations key insights

üõ† Technical explanation of how I solved this integration project.

‚óè Data Preprocessing:
> First, preprocessed the data. Devoted a significant amount of time to this step as it is a crucial part of every analytical task.
> Analyzed and understood each of technical details related to the business case, done EDA using python. Pre-processed the data. Explained the data insights, outcomes, and experimental findings with teams, and led in meetings and discussions.

‚óè Machine Learning:
- Incorporated the work did in the preprocessing part into the code necessary for making the next step. 
- Developed a model that predicts the probability of an individual being excessively absent from work.
- Numerous machine learning tools and techniques helped at this stage
- At the end, stored the work as a Python module called it as ‚Äòabsenteeism_module‚Äô and thus preserved it in a form suitable for further analysis.

‚óè Loading the ‚Äòabsenteeism_module‚Äô and integrating Python and SQL:
- loaded the ‚Äòabsenteeism_module‚Äô and used its methods to obtain predictions.
 - Then, integrated Jupyter and MySQL Workbench to show an example of how Python and SQL can be connected. 
- At the end,exported the final version of the data set as a *.csv file that was ready for furtherr analysis and visualization.

‚óè Analyzed the predicted outputs in Tableau:
- Finally, utilized Tableau to analyse three separate dependencies between the inputs of model. 
- The visualizations obtained with this software helped with great deal while looking for insight!!
