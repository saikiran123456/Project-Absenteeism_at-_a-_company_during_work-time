# Project-Absenteeism_at_a_company_during_work-time

**The Main AIM of this Project is that to show how i can integrate different Softwares through API Integrations**

- Integrating: Python + MySQL + Tableau  to solve the Business problem

✅ To solve any Business Problems - I like to Connect Python with various Sources like Databases and Visualization software like Tableau and PowerBI.
In short, I like the entire pipeline which solves business problems using Software API Integrations.

● 1.Business Problem:
- The problem is that the business environment of today is more competitive than it used to be.
- This leads to increased pressure in the workplace.
- Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that unachievable business goals and an elevated risk of unemployment can raise people's stress levels
- The purpose of the business exercise will be to explore whether a person presenting certain characteristics is expected to be away from work at some point in time or not.

● Final outcome:
> - To develop a model that will predict the probability of an individual being excessively absent from work with visualizations key insights

🛠 Technical explanation of how I solved this integration project.

● Data Preprocessing:
> - First, preprocessed the data. Devoted a significant amount of time to this step as it is a crucial part of every analytical task.
> - Analyzed and understood each of technical details related to the business case, done EDA using python. Pre-processed the data. Explained the data insights, outcomes, and experimental findings with teams, and led in meetings and discussions.

● Machine Learning:
> - Incorporated the work did in the preprocessing part into the code necessary for making the next step. 
> - Developed a model that predicts the probability of an individual being excessively absent from work.
> - Numerous machine learning tools and techniques helped at this stage
> - At the end, stored the work as a Python module called it as ‘absenteeism_module’ and thus preserved it in a form suitable for further analysis.

● Loading the ‘absenteeism_module’ and integrating Python and SQL:
> - loaded the ‘absenteeism_module’ and used its methods to obtain predictions.
> - Then, integrated Jupyter and MySQL Workbench to show an example of how Python and SQL can be connected. 
> - At the end,exported the final version of the data set as a *.csv file that was ready for furtherr analysis and visualization.

● Analyzed the predicted outputs in Tableau:
> - Finally, utilized Tableau to analyse three separate dependencies between the inputs of model. 
> - The visualizations obtained with this software helped with great deal while looking for insight!


This is all about my Data Science End-To-End Project I hope You liked it and found it insightfull, you can try out in your projects as well!!
